# 532-Matrix-Methods-and-ML


Here are my solutions to the assignments as well as my notes for 532 Matrix Methods and ML, A graduate level machine learning course I took while completing my bachelor's in Physics at the University of Wisconsin Madison. The course covered the theory and implementation of ML concepts.

Mathematical topics covered: linear equations, regression, regularization, singular value decomposition, and iterative algorithms.

Machine learning topics covered: the lasso, support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering, dictionary learning, neural networks, and deep learning
